# The 1987 Constitution states that ARTICLE XI Section 3.4

"In case the verified complaint or resolution of impeachment is filed by at least one-third of all the Members of the House, the same shall constitute the Articles of Impeachment, and trial by the Senate shall **forthwith** proceed."

In other words...

# AGAD-AGAD

> “I also wrote the procedural Section including the word ‘forthwith’ … it is precisely meant to mean immediately and without unreasonable delay or in the National language official version ‘agad-agad.’”  
> — **Adolf Azcuna**, *Drafter of Article XI of the 1987 Constitution*  
> *Published June 8, 2025, GMA News*

> ⚠️ **This is not a suggestion. This is constitutional intent.**
>
> The use of the word **‘forthwith’** in the 1987 Constitution is **deliberate, precise, and legally binding**. It means:
>
> - **Immediately**  
> - **Without unreasonable delay**  
> - **Agad-agad** in the official Filipino version

### 🧨 So Why the Delay?

Senate President **Chiz Escudero** is attempting to twist the clear meaning of the Constitution. His public statements **contradict the very words of its drafter**.

Any delay now is **willful disobedience** of constitutional duty. This is not bureaucracy — this is **dereliction**. The people are not confused. The law is not confused. The only confusion is the kind being used to buy time.

## 🚨 The People Demand Action – Forthwith

Senate President **Chiz Escudero** refuses to begin the impeachment trial **forthwith** — despite using the term himself and knowing exactly what it means.

He has dismissed the voices of **student organizations**, **religious groups**, **civil-society movements**, **universities**, and even **law schools** — all calling for the trial to proceed **immediately**.

> He says he “will not listen to anyone.”

**We pay their salaries. We voted them into power. They should listen to us.**

This is not political theater. This is accountability.
