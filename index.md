# ARTICLE XI Section 3.4 of the 1987 Constitution

"In case the verified complaint or resolution of impeachment is filed by at least one-third of all the Members of the House, the same shall constitute the Articles of Impeachment, and trial by the Senate shall **forthwith** proceed."

*In other words...*

## AGAD-AGAD

## Why the Delay?

Senate President **Chiz Escudero** says that he does not understand the definition of **forthwith** saying the constitution does not use the word "immediately" completely twisting clear meaning of the Constitution. His public statements **contradict the very words of its drafter**.

> “I also wrote the procedural Section including the word ‘forthwith’ … it is precisely meant to mean immediately and without unreasonable delay or in the National language official version ‘agad-agad.’”  
>
> — **Adolf Azcuna**, 
>
> *Drafter of Article XI of the 1987 Constitution*  
> *Published June 8, 2025, GMA News*

⚠️ **This is not a suggestion. This is an order.**

The use of the word ‘forthwith’ in the 1987 Constitution is **deliberate, precise, and legally binding**. It means:

- **Immediately**  
- **Without unreasonable delay**  
- **Agad-agad** in the official Filipino version


Any delay now is willful disobedience o the senate's constitutional duty.

## 🚨 The People Demand Action

Senate President **Chiz Escudero** refuses to begin the impeachment trial **forthwith**, despite using the term himself and knowing exactly what it means. 

He has already dismissed the growing list of voices from **student organizations**, **religious groups**, **civil-society movements**, **universities**, and even **law schools**.

### Let's be clear

> The people are not confused. 
> The law is not confused. 

The only people confused are the senators who refuse to conduct the trial forthwith.

This is not just a political excercise this is about accountability, due process, and the rule of law. We must demand our senators uphold the constitution!

**We pay their salaries.**
**We voted for them.**
**They should listen to us.**

Let your senators know:  
> **The people demand the trial proceed forthwith.**

I am writing as a concerned citizen to demand that you fulfill your constitutional duty and proceed with the impeachment trial forthwith. 

The law is clear. The mandate is clear. The public clamor is deafening. There is no excuse for delay.

The Filipino people are watching. You serve at our pleasure. Do not delay justice. Do not silence our voices.

Forthwith means immediately. agad-agad.
